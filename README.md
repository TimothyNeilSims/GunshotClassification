# Analysis of Gunshot Sounds using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze gunshot sounds using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is a multi-firearm, multi-orientation audio dataset of gunshots. The dataset contains audio recordings of four different types of firearms, each shot with three different firing styles. The recordings have been cropped from the original recordings for ease of use. The dataset used can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/7004819).
